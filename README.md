# Welcome to the covid-self-report project

## Flatten the curve, right?

We know that the state impact of the prevalence of the spread COVID-19 today will actually impactbe felt by the society in a few days’ time. Testing and isolation are the two main strategies to then forecast or reduce this impact. Isolation affects the economy significantly. Testing is expensive, not widely available, and in some countries limited. Anyway Iit is near to impossible to test everyone in on the planet. **We want to allow communities to self-report their health status, and allow decision-makers to get a picture of the spread in ‘real-time’ to close that the time gap between infections today and the impact in the following days.**


The platrform consists ofn a frontend (vue.js) in which the user reports their sympntoms and provides their postal code anonymously. The data is then analysed (python) and sent to the backend (firebase). No data is stored in local machines.
Thanks to all that who have supported us so far to provide statistical visualizations of the current Covid-19 pandemica. This project started Friday 20 March 2020 and was launched on:


- [Switzerland](https://covid-self-report.ch/): In production since the 24 March 2020. 
- [India](https://covid-self-report.in/): In production since the 30 March 2020. 
- [Mexico](https://covid-me-reporto.mx/): In production since the 31 March 2020. 
- [Italia](https://covid-self-report.it/): In production since the 5 April 2020.
- Pakistan: In production since the 6 April 2020
- Malta: Under development
- Poland: Under development
- Israel: Under development
- Others countries: we are looking for team leaders

We are planning to deploy our app in as many country as we can but for that **we need your help**.

## What is the plan?

To be able to replicate our app in different countries, we need teams in each country to deploy, maintain, and manage social network. The idea is to duplicate the app and not centralize the all the effort in one team...Open source is much more fun.

**Warning**: this means that every team has to find a credit card that can support the cost of the traffic by country. 
The costs are very low on firebase but do your calculation based on the targeted population country.
We will soon search for financial support...(#funding on slack)

## I want to replicate the app for a country, what do I need?

You will need developers that can understand our code, translators, and people to manage the social network... and of course a domain name. We have a large team now, and as people free up from deployments they can help with yours as well. Ultimately you will become the webmaster for your country.
