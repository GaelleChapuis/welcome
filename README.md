# Welcome to the covid-self-report project

## What do we want to do?

**We want to allow communities to self-report their health status and zone to produce a 'real-time' picture of the situation with a geographical reference.**

## Why do we want to do it?

We believe that having a 'real-time' picture of the situation with a geographical reference has three major advantages:
  1. Allows descision-makers to respond to the current state of the situation, and not with the result consequence of the situation from days before.
  2. A geographical depiction of the situation can allow a more effective distribution of resources.
  3. Mapping of the situation can also allow a selective process of quarantine zones.

Capitalising on these advantages, the health systems would remain functional and the economy would continue to thrive in currently unaffected areas.

## What is the caveat?

The data is unofficial and the effectivness of the system relies on the active participation of the populaition. 

## How are we doing it?

The platrform consists ofn a frontend (vue.js) in which the user reports their sympntoms and provides their postal code anonymously. The data is then analysed (python) and sent to the backend (firebase). No data is stored in local machines.

## What have we done so far?

Thanks to all that who have supported us so far to provide statistical visualizations of the current Covid-19 pandemic. This project started Friday 20 March 2020 and was launched on:

- [Switzerland](https://covid-self-report.ch/): In production since 24 March 2020. 
- [India](https://covid-self-report.in/): In production since 30 March 2020. 
- [Mexico](https://covid-me-reporto.mx/): In production since 31 March 2020. 
- [Italia](https://covid-self-report.it/): In production since 5 April 2020.
- [Pakistan](https://covid-self-report.pk): In production since 6 April 2020
- Malta: Under development
- Poland: Under development
- UK: Under develeopment
- Israel: Under development
- Others countries: we are looking for team leaders

We are planning to deploy our app in as many country as we can but for that **we need your help**.

## What is the plan?

To be able to replicate our app in different countries. We need teams in each country to deploy, maintain, and manage their social networks. The idea is to duplicate the app and not centralize all the effort in one team...Open source is much more fun!

**Warning**: This means that every team has to find a credit card that can support the cost of the traffic by country. 
The costs are very low on firebase but do your calculation based on the targeted population country.
We will soon search for financial support...(#funding on slack)

## I want to replicate the app for a country, what do I need?

You will need developers that can understand our code, translators, and people to manage the social network... and of course a domain name. We have a large team now, and as people free up from deployments they can help with yours as well. Ultimately you will become the webmaster for your country.
