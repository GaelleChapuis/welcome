# Welcome in the covid-self-report project

First of all, thanks for supporting us to provide statistical visualizations of the current Covid-19 pandemia.

This project started friday 20 march 2020 and was launched on:
- [Switzerland](https://covid-self-report.ch/) on the 24 march 2020. 

We are looking planing to deploy our app in as many country as we can but for that, **we need your help**.

## What is the plan?

To be able to replicate our app in different countries, we need teams by country to deploy, maintain, and manage social network.

The idea is to duplicate the app and not centralize the all the effort on one team...Open source if much more fun.

**Warning**: this means that every team has to find a credit card that can support the cost of the traffic by country. 
The cost are very low on firebase but do your calculation based on the targeted population country.
We will soon search for financial support...(#funding on slack)

## I want to replicate the app for a country, what do I need?

You need developers that can understand our code, translators, peoples to manage social network...and of course a domain name.
