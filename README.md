We are looking planing to deploy our app in as many country as we can but for that, **we need your help**.

## What is the plan?

To be able to replicate our app in different countries, we need teams by country to deploy, maintain, and manage social network.

The idea is to duplicate the app and not centralize the all the effort on one team...Open source if much more fun.

**Warning**: this means that every team has to find a credit card that can support the cost of the traffic by country. 
The cost are very low on firebase but do your calculation based on the targeted population country.
We will soon search for financial support...(#funding on slack)

## I want to replicate the app for a country, what do I need?

You will need developers that can understand our code, translators, people to manage social network...and of course a domain name. We have a large team now, and as people free up from deployments can help with yours as well. Ultimately you will become the webmaster for your country.
